# Week 8 - Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
### Hypothesis 
Writing out code by hand will help improve memory and understanding 

### Test

Find two activities that are somewhat similar in complexity and content length

1st activity https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp 

Review the page, run and test the code in the editor on the site

Spend around 15 minutes doing this

2nd activity https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp 

Review the page, run and test the code in the editor on the site

Spend around 15 minutes doing this

Take the time to write out what you remember, including code examples from memory

Do this until you write out everything you can remember

Wait about 24 hours after each activity and try to recall what was done in each activity, type this out in a word document.

### Results
I found I could remember more of what I did from activity 2 for example, the structure of the form.

### Conclusion
The hypothesis was supported in this test, although taking the time to write out code by hand can be time-consuming but it shows simply reviewing the code doesnâ€™t help you remember it.


## Estimated hours
2 hours spent practical


## Group work project

Spent time talking about what had been completed since the last meeting, this being the website hosting, documentations and trello board.

Reviewed the content that will be added to the site, split the tasks and made sure everyone was on the same page on how to make changes/update the site.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Being able to work in a team in a development environment is a valuable skill, being able to plan and cordinate tasks with everyone contributing to the same project.
