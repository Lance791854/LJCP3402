# Week 10 - Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I created a video demonstrating the process of deploying our WordPress site, from local development to staging and production. It covers version control and the steps involved in each stage of deployment.

Found a free tool that as a group we decided to use to easily transfer our site from staging to production https://wpvivid.com/

## Estimated hours
6 hours

## Content Insights
By documenting the steps I now have a reusable video that others can follow.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Being able to explain and teach others is a valuable skill, especially when creating documentation and resources that make complex processes easy to follow.
