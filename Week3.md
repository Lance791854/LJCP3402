# Week 2 - Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week I set up a WordPress server on Hetzner. This was pretty straightforward with some issues faced when trying to SSH into the server to configure it. 

I then changed the site and included content from my Joomla site to fill it out.

Made use of Hetzner docs and WordPress docs when I needed to do something.

I have used Hetzner before for other tasks so was familiar with setting stuff up. Also have used WordPress for a couple of other projects so I was familiar with it.

## Estimated Hours

Roughly 3 Hours

## Content Insights

Setting up WordPress on Hetzner, which was different from using something like cPanel which I am used to.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

According to Google 43% of sites use WordPress which makes knowing how to deploy/set up a wordpress server and manage it a useful skill.
