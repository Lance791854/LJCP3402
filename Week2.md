# Content Insight
Joomla makes it easy to create content and pages but it was a difficult to navigate the controls, had trouble figuring out how to align an image

Many different hosting platforms, tried a couple of free hosting platforms but would of been easier to go with a paid hosting.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Joomla makes building a site easier espically if you dont want to learn html/css but feels very restrictive.

Setting up a web host and installing CMS is an important to learn as it may be required in many real projects.
