# Week 6 - Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I set up a trello board and linked it to our groups slack channel. I set up a wordpress server on digital ocean, linked a domain and used github actions to implement an auto update solution so when changes are made to the repo they are also updated on the live site.
