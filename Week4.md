# Week 4 - Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
Researched locally hosted solutions and went with LocalWP to set up a local WordPress server

Moved my site that was hosted on Hetzner from the Week 3 practical with a plugin called Duplicator https://duplicator.com/

Learned how to create dynamic portfolios, this involved editing PHP to add functions and another page that allows post data to load dynamically.

## Estimated hours
4 hours

## Content Insights
I found it very easy to set up LocalWP and moved my site extremely easily and quickly.

When creating the dynamic portfolios, I knew this could be done easily with plugins like Elementor but setting it up myself gave me a better understanding of customizing themes.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning how to set up a development environment and use it without affecting a live site is essential for web development.

Being able to edit PHP and create new features without the use of external plugins is a good skill to have.
